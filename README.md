Android Coding Guidelines
=========================

Workflow
--------

We follow gitflow. To avoid confusion in branches we name them after author and story from jira e.g.

> james/SG-1012-image-in-article-is-cut-off

Coding Style
------------

At TAB we follow Android Code Style guidelines

https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html#follow-field-naming-conventions

On top of rules listed there we have few extra rules and exceptions:

###Follow Field Naming Conventions

- Do NOT use m or s prefix in fields inside POJO (models, events)

*good:* 

    public class LoginEvent {
        private boolean success;
        
        public LoginEvent (boolean success) {
          this.success = success;
        }
   
        public boolean getSuccess() {
          return success;
        }
    }

*bad:*

    public class LoginEvent {
      private boolean mSuccess;
      
      public LoginEvent (boolean success) {
        mSuccess = success;
      }
   
      public boolean getSuccess() {
        return mSuccess;
      }
    }

- Use full words

*good:* 

    mInitalDownloadTimestamp

*bad:* 

    mInitDlTimestamp

- Try to place most important part of the name in the first or last part of the name

*good:* 

    mInitialDownloadTimestamp

*not so good:* 

    mDownloadInitialTimestamp

(important part is that this is a timestamp and it is initial one)

- be explicit in choosing names

*good:*

     calculateDownloadDuration()

*not so good:* 

     duration()

We use obfuscation so there is no harm in using long names

###Use Standard Brace Style

- Avoid one line braceless conditions

*good:* 

    if (condtion) {
        body();
    }

*bad:* 

    if (condition) body();

###Use Standard Java Annotations

- Even a single annotation should be above the annotated field/method/class

*good:*

    @Override
    public void onCrate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { ... }

*bad:*

    @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { ... }

(we want to keep method signature lines short as possible to use more explicit method names)


###Log Sparingly

Implement or use Logger which allows filtering log calls per subsystem

*good:*

    TabLog.e(TabLog.UI,"Cannot determine image size");

*not so good:*

    Log.e("Cannot determine image size");
